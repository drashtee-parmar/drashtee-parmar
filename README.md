<h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm Drashtee üëã </h1>

<h2 align="center">üìù About me</h2>

<!-- <h2 align="center"><img src="Image/Light Modern Textile Minimalism Desktop Wallpaper.jpg"></h2> -->

<!-- I am Drashtee Parmar. Currently student and persuing Master's of Science in Computer Science, major in Artificial Intelligence at Kennesaw State University. I had worked previously at ADP as a Software Engineer. I am very keen to learn new technologies and use them in real life or improve existing softwares. -->
As an accomplished Machine Learning Engineer, I bring 5+ years of hands-on experience in developing and implementing machine learning models to solve complex business problems. My proficiency extends to Python, Scala, and Java with a strong background in data analysis and algorithm design. 

I have a proven track record of effectively managing large-scale projects, demonstrating exceptional leadership while collaborating with cross-functional teams. My expertise includes Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Machine Learning Algorithms, AI Products like TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, SpaCy, NumPy and Pandas.

One of my significant achievements was the development and implementation of a state-of-the-art conversational AI interface leveraging TensorFlow and GPT-3. This resulted in a remarkable 25% enhancement in user interaction quality. I also led deep learning initiatives utilizing the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus for training which resulted in an outstanding 92% response accuracy.

In another project at Kennesaw State University, I led the development and deployment of a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm to optimize student-faculty communication using an AI-powered chatbot. This resulted in a 55% reduction in query response times.

I am always open to new opportunities where I can leverage my skills to solve challenging problems using machine learning techniques. Feel free to reach out if you believe we could work together or exchange ideas!
